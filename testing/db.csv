5651,15,2792,6386,what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .,"('software',)","(-2,)"

5685,15,2793,6420,a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names .,"('no sentiment',)","(0,)"
5686,15,2793,6421,this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad .,"('no sentiment',)","(0,)"

5688,15,2793,6423,other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .,"('tag',)","(-2,)"

5692,15,2793,6427,the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing .,"('no sentiment',)","(0,)"
